# AES-FILE-ENCRYPT
This is a demo that involves 2 python scripts that will allow you to encrypt and decrypt the file using AES encryption 
This is not a production script, just shows proof of concept on how to encrypt a file using a script
I would personally make a third script for decrypting the file so that you are not commenting something out everytime 
Finally, I would put in a way for the user to enter the directory of the file instead of having to hard code it into the script
